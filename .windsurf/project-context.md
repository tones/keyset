# Project Context — Key Sets

## Overview

A web app for managing "key sets" — collections of piano key selections organized by song. Each song contains ordered key sets, and each key set contains a set of MIDI note selections visualized on a piano keyboard.

## Setup (Fresh Clone)

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
npm run dev
```

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, Server Components, Server Actions)
- **Database:** Prisma ORM with SQLite
- **LLM:** Anthropic Claude (via @anthropic-ai/sdk) for music theory analysis
- **Drag-and-drop:** @dnd-kit (core, sortable, utilities)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4 with @tailwindcss/typography (prose classes)
- **Markdown:** react-markdown for rendering LLM analysis output
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Testing:** Playwright E2E tests

## Data Model

```
Song (id, title, analysis?, analysisUpdatedAt?, createdAt, updatedAt)
  └─ KeySet (id, name?, position, songId, createdAt, updatedAt)
       └─ KeyPress (id, midiNote, keySetId, createdAt)
```

- `KeySet` has a `@@unique([songId, position])` constraint — reordering requires a two-phase update (set positions to negative temps, then to final values) to avoid constraint violations.
- `KeyPress` stores MIDI note numbers (0–127). Cascade delete is configured: deleting a Song deletes its KeySets, deleting a KeySet deletes its KeyPresses.

## URI Scheme

- `/` — Home page, lists all songs
- `/song/:id` — Song detail page with key set cards

Uses **singular nouns** (`/song/`), not plurals.

## Key Components

- **`PianoKeyboard`** (`src/components/PianoKeyboard.tsx`) — Renders a piano keyboard with highlighted notes. Supports an optional `onToggle` callback for interactive mode. Uses absolute positioning with a boundary-based algorithm for black key placement. Has `data-testid="piano-keyboard"` for test selection and `data-note` attributes on each key.
- **`EditableTitle`** (`src/components/EditableTitle.tsx`) — Generic inline-editable title. Click to edit, Enter to save, Escape to cancel. Accepts an `onSave` callback prop.
- **`SongList`** (`src/components/SongList.tsx`) — Client component rendering song cards as clickable links on the home page. Includes trash icon with confirmation dialog for deleting songs.
- **`SortableKeySetList`** (`src/components/SortableKeySetList.tsx`) — Drag-and-drop sortable list of key set cards using @dnd-kit. Includes add (plus icon), delete (trash icon with confirmation), inline key set rename actions. Piano keys are toggled inline with optimistic UI updates and immediate server persistence. Shows deterministic chord label (via `chordId`) that updates live as notes are toggled.
- **`chordId`** (`src/lib/chordId.ts`) — Utility function `identifyChord(midiNotes)` that identifies chords from MIDI notes using the `tonal` library (`Chord.detect`). Handles inversions, extended chords (9ths, 11ths, 13ths), altered chords, slash chords, and more. Returns standard chord symbols like "CM", "Dm7", "G7".
- **`SongAnalysis`** (`src/components/SongAnalysis.tsx`) — Client component that shows cached LLM analysis or triggers a new one via the Analyze Song button. Displays timestamp of when analysis was generated. Includes trash icon to delete cached analysis with confirmation. Renders markdown via `react-markdown` with Tailwind `prose` classes. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var.

## Important Gotchas

- **Next.js 16 `params` is a Promise** — In dynamic route pages, `params` must be `await`ed before accessing properties. Type as `{ params: Promise<{ id: string }> }`.
- **Piano key colors** — Inline styles use hex (`#ef4444`, `#ffffff`) but browsers normalize to `rgb()` in computed styles. Playwright tests must use `getComputedStyle()` to check colors.
- **KeySet position uniqueness** — The `@@unique([songId, position])` constraint means you can't naively update positions in a transaction. Use the two-phase negative-temp approach in `reorderKeySets`.

## Server Actions

- `src/app/actions.ts` — `createSong` (creates "Untitled Song", redirects to it), `deleteSong` (deletes song with cascade, revalidates home)
- `src/app/song/[id]/actions.ts` — `updateSongTitle`, `reorderKeySets`, `createKeySet`, `deleteKeySet`, `toggleKeyPress`, `updateKeySetName`
- `src/app/song/[id]/analyze.ts` — `analyzeSong` (calls Anthropic Claude, caches result in Song.analysis), `clearAnalysis` (removes cached analysis from Song)

## Keeping This File Up to Date

When making changes to the codebase, **always** update the relevant `.windsurf/` files before committing:

- **`project-context.md`** — Update when adding/removing/renaming components, server actions, routes, data model fields, or gotchas.
- **`workflows/testing.md`** — Update when changing how tests are run, adding new test files, or changing test conventions.
