# Testing

## Running Tests

```bash
npm run test:e2e              # recommended: seeds a separate test.db, starts server on port 3001, runs all tests
npm run test:e2e -- --headed  # same but watch the browser run tests
```

This uses `scripts/test-e2e.sh` which:
1. Sets `DATABASE_URL` to `file:./test.db` (your `dev.db` is never touched)
2. Sets `AUTH_PASSWORD` to `test-password` (auth is enabled during tests)
3. Runs `prisma migrate deploy` and seeds the test database
4. Runs `npx playwright test`, which starts a Next.js dev server on port 3001

You can pass any Playwright CLI flags after `--`, e.g. `npm run test:e2e -- --grep "rename"`.

### Cascade: How to Run Tests

- **Do NOT pipe output** through `tail`, `head`, `grep`, etc. — piping causes the command to hang silently. Always run `npm run test:e2e 2>&1` with no pipe.
- Run as a **non-blocking** command with `WaitMsBeforeAsync: 10000`, then poll with `command_status` using `WaitDurationSeconds: 45`. If it hasn't finished in ~90 seconds total, assume it hung — kill and retry.
- **Always reboot the dev server** after running tests: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null; npm run dev`
- The test suite normally completes in ~30 seconds.
- **Route warmup:** `test-e2e.sh` hits `/`, `/song/1`, and `/login` before running Playwright to trigger Turbopack compilation. This eliminates cold-compile flakiness on first runs after `git pull`, `npm install`, or clearing `.next/`.

## Convention

Whenever a new behavior or feature is added to the app, **always** add a corresponding Playwright E2E test in the `e2e/` directory. If an existing behavior is changed, update the relevant test to match.

## Test Structure

Playwright is configured with three projects in `playwright.config.ts`:
- **setup** (`e2e/auth.setup.ts`) — Logs in via `/login` and saves the session cookie to `e2e/.auth/session.json`
- **authenticated** — Runs `home.spec.ts` and `song.spec.ts` with the stored auth session (full edit access)
- **public** — Runs `auth.spec.ts` without any session (read-only access)

Test files:
- `e2e/auth.setup.ts` — Login setup, saves auth state for authenticated tests
- `e2e/auth.spec.ts` — Public read-only access tests (no login wall, hidden edit controls, login/logout flow, wrong password)
- `e2e/home.spec.ts` — Home page tests (listing songs, creating new songs, deleting songs)
- `e2e/song.spec.ts` — Song page tests (rename song, rename keyset, reorder key sets, add/delete key sets, color palette, LLM analysis display/delete, navigation, staff toggle, guide line alignment, scale degrees, compact mode)

## Writing New Tests

- Use `page.getByTestId()`, `page.getByRole()`, and `page.getByText()` for selectors — avoid fragile CSS selectors
- Piano key colors must be checked via `getComputedStyle()` since the browser normalizes inline hex styles to `rgb()`
- Tests that mutate shared database state should clean up after themselves (e.g., restore renamed titles, delete added items)
- All three test files run serially (`test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' })`) because they share database state
